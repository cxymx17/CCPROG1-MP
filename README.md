### Core Gameplay Mechanics
- **Shop Exploration**: Travel between six unique shops, each with its own set of items and daily-changing prices. Specialty items are always available at a discount.
- **Trading System**: Buy and sell rare items to take advantage of price differences and maximize profits. Prices and availability change each day, and some items may be sold out.
- **Debt and Banking**: Manage a growing debt that increases by 15% each day, deposit or withdraw Gil for 10% daily interest, and pay off or take new loans through the Merchant of the Rift.
- **Time Management**: Each shop visit advances the day. The player must pay off the debt and end with positive Gil within 30 days to win.
