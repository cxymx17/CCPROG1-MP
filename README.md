# CCPROG1 (Machine Project)

This program is a game called GILGAMESH'S MEGA GIL ADVENTURES, in which he must pay back his debt to retrieve his Genji Equipment. He has 30 days to pay his debts by traveling to different worlds and buying and selling items from shops. 
The program allows the user to buy and sell items and complete the quest, or else the user will inevitably lose the game, and Gilgamesh will not get his Genji Equipment back.
